# Markdown
Refactor a Markdown parser.

The markdown exercise is a refactoring exercise. There is code that parses a given string with Markdown syntax and returns the associated HTML for that string. Even though this code is confusingly written and hard to follow, somehow it works and all the tests are passing! Your challenge is to re-write this code to make it easier to read and maintain while still making sure that all the tests keep passing.

It would be helpful if you made notes of what you did in your refactoring in comments so reviewers can see that, but it isn't strictly necessary. The most important thing is to make the code better!

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/ruby).

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

If you would like color output, you can `require 'minitest/pride'` in
the test file, or note the alternative instruction, below, for running
the test file.

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise
directory. For example, if the test suite is called
`hello_world_test.rb`, you can run the following command:

    ruby hello_world_test.rb

To include color from the command line:

    ruby -r minitest/pride hello_world_test.rb
